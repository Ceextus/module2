    <p>The giant panda, native to China, is one of the most beloved animals in the world. Known for its distinctive black and white coat, the panda spends much of its day eating bamboo, which makes up around 99% of its diet. Despite its large size, the panda is known for its gentle nature and is considered a national symbol of peace in China.</p>
