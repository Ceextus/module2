  <h1>Olaf's Favorite Seasons</h1>
  
  <h2 id="olaf">Summer</h2>
  <p>Olaf, the sun-loving snowman, dreams of enjoying the warmth of summer. He loves the idea of basking under the sun, even though heâ€™s made of snow!</p>
  
  <h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>
  <p>Spring is another favorite for Olaf because of the blooming flowers and the gentle sunshine. He admires the new life all around and the slightly warmer weather.</p>
